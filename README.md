# SkinCare-Recommendation-System

Small demo showcasing a simple command line autocomplete for skincare
categories. The code illustrates how to store structured data in a Python
dictionary and perform efficient prefix lookup using the ``bisect`` module.

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 Skincarerecommendation.py
```

Then type a search prefix to see matching categories and select one to view its
description and sample products.
